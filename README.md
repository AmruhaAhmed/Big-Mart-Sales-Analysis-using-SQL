The Big Mart table has 12 attributes:

1.Item_Identifier

2.Item_Weight

3.Item_Fat_Content

4.Item_Visibility

5.Item_Type

6.Item_MRP

7.Outlet_Identifier

8.Outlet_Establishment_Year

9.Outlet_Size

10.Outlet_Location_Type

11.Outlet_Type

12.Item_Outlet_Sales

I have extracted valuable insights regarding the sales of various items and outlets from this table using SQL. 

Here are the top 5 insights I have gathered from the table:

1.Low fat items have the highest amount of sales

2.OUT046 has the highest amount of sales whereas OUT010 has the lowest amount of sales

3.medium sized outlets have proven to be most profitable since they have the highest sales

4.Starchy Foods are in high demand as average sales are higher than the rest of the types. 

5.Supermarket Type2 have the highest amount of average sales whereas grocery stores have the least amount of average sales
